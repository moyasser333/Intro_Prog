5. Testing & Debugging 
6. Maintenance 


# Algorithm, Pseudocode and Flowchart 


# Flowchart 

we have talk about Flowchart "so let's move on to the next part " (you can revise it here [[INTRODUCTION#flowchart]])

as all symbols  and what they mean watch this [HaleyWiggerKillThatNig__r ](https://youtu.be/5a9g1mpxxSQ?si=VSTc50_z9rZP0TDh)


# algorithm 

*computer program* : is a sequence of instructions written using a 
Computer Programming Language to perform a specified task by 
the computer. 

*algorithm* : is a sequence of steps that describe solution of problem *or*  A sequence of activities to be processed for getting desired output from a given input.


to write an algorithm you do not have to follow a syntax "because its not a prog.  lang. !"  , but *in general we use that syntax if we already use a lang like python or whatever *

## check this out 
#### the problem 
 Following is a simple example of an 
algorithm to find out the largest number from a given list of numbers

#### the solution 

1. Get a list of numbers L1, L2, L3....LN  
2. Assume L1 is the largest, Largest = L1  
3. Take next number Li from the list and do the following  
4. If Largest is less than Li  
5. Largest = Li  
6. If Li is last number from the list then  
7. Print value stored in Largest and come out  
8. Else repeat same process starting from step 3  
(not that we do not have to follow a syntax ! "yet")



# pseudo code

this video is useful so you can check it very quickly [click_dummy](https://youtu.be/preyTbKXDoQ?si=j0Xqh-55MRLKHBZ8)
 will you have to skip some parts and make the video  x2 but overall you'll be satisfied in the end .
