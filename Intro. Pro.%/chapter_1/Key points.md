1. is the microprocessors in the mainframe computers are different ?
   A: yes it is cause it is design for high data management and high transaction processing.

2. Where are the Microprocessors Located?
   A: in the  central processing complex (CPC), which is the main cabinet of the mainframe system.{الخزانة (غالبًا ما تُسمى الشاسي أو المجمع المركزي للمعالجة (CPC))}.

3. what is the main different between the mainframe computer and the supercomputer ?
   A: supercomputers use all its power just to execute a few programs as fast as possible , on the other hand the mainframe computers executes many programs concurrently .{بشكل متزامن}
   
4. what is more powerful a mainframe computer or a supercomputer ?
   A: mainframe are more powerful than the supercomputers , but supercomputer can execute single program faster than the mainframe one  and that is the main point .
   
5. is the workstation part microcomputers ? and what classification that mini PCs belongs to ?
   A: first , workstation computers ==are not==  part of microcomputers , second mini PCs are classified as a microcomputers .Cannot store data like digital computers.
   
6. how can we read info and what is the Main output device in Analog computers ?
   A: Analog computers present data in the form of graphs and can only provide approximate estimates. 
   
7. Can Analog computers store data like the Digital once ?
   A: Can't store data like digital computers. 

8. which one is faster  Digital comp. or  Analog comp. ?
   A:  check  [[ch.1_computers#Speed Comparison Between Digital and Analog Computers]]

9. why Analog computers are faster just in {handling continuous data} ? 
   A: analog computers do not use these logical {AND ,OR,XOR and NOT gates } operations in the same way because ==they process data as continuous signals rather than discrete binary values in *real-time*== processes.
   But it ==may be slower in computations== !
