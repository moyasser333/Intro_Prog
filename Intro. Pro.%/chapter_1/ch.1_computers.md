- Classification of computers is based on there factors 
 1. ==size and capacity ==
 2. ==purposes ==
 3. ==hardware design and Type==

- computers are classified on uses and size as following

1. Analog computers {الكمبيوتر التناظري} :
   Analog computers aren't classified as microcomputers, mainframes, or supercomputers ==because these classifications are primarily used for digital computers==, but they can still be grouped by size and purpose.
   Uses : processes data ==in the form of continuous physical quantities==, ==such as voltage, speed, or temperature==. It performs calculations using direct measurement rather than digital signals, making it suitable for simulations and solving complex mathematical equations, often ==used in scientific and engineering Applications== .

- examples :
1. Petrol pumps
2. analog clocks
3. speedometers
4. voltmeters 

- all computers { Digital or Analog } have similar components for receiving, processing, sorting, and transmitting data .
